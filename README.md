Audio Spectrum Visualizer in Rust

## Abstract

Audiolyzer is a personal project that I created to advance my Rust skills and learn more about audio processing. It will take currently playing audio and dissasemble it into discrete frequency buckets and display the sound level of each bucket in real time.
